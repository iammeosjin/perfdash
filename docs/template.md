# Performance Scoring System ({PROJECT_VERSION})

## Overview

The Performance Scoring System serves as a cornerstone of our development
culture, combining incentives with continuous improvement principles. This
system is transparent and objective, making it easy to track and communicate
performance. Developers can monitor their progress and understand how their
contributions impact the team's overall performance. This system is not just a
means of recognition; it is a catalyst for growth, enabling us to deliver better
products, faster, and with higher quality.

## Pull Request Scoring

### Points for Pull Request Review

For each pull request reviewed, developers will be awarded points as follows:

- Junior Developers:
  - If the junior developer is the first to review: {JFPRR} points
  - If the junior developer is not the first to review: {JPRR} points
- Senior Developers:
  - If the senior developer is the first to review: {SFPRR} points
  - If the senior developer is not the first to review: {SPRR} points

### Points for Pull Request Lead Time

Developers, regardless of their seniority, will be awarded points based on the
lead time of their pull requests as follows:

| Lead Time                | Points    |
| ------------------------ | --------- |
| 0 minutes to 15 minutes  | 10 points |
| 15 minutes to 30 minutes | 8 points  |
| 30 minutes to 1 hour     | 6 points  |
| 1 hour to 12 hours       | 4 points  |
| 12 hours to 24 hours     | 2 points  |
| Above 24 hours           | 1 point   |

## Importance

The Pull Request Scoring System serves several important purposes:

1. **Promoting Efficient Code Reviews:** By awarding points for reviewing pull
   requests, the system encourages team members to actively participate in code
   reviews, which can lead to higher-quality code and faster development cycles.

2. **Recognizing Seniority:** The system recognizes the seniority of developers
   by offering different points for reviewing pull requests. Senior developers
   who are proactive in reviewing code are rewarded for their experience and
   leadership.

3. **Incentivizing Timely Merges:** Points awarded based on lead time motivate
   developers to submit pull requests that can be quickly merged. This not only
   accelerates development but also reduces the chances of conflicts and
   integration issues. Developers who consistently merge their pull requests
   swiftly will receive higher scores, indicating their commitment to efficient
   project management.

## JIRA Task Cycle Scoring

### Points for Task Completion

The number of points awarded for completing tasks depends on the task type and
the presence of subtasks:

- Subtask:
  - Junior Developers: {JSTDC} points
  - Senior Developers: {SSTDC} points

- Bug (with subtask):
  - Junior Developers: {JBDCMAX} points
  - Senior Developers: {SBDCMAX} points

- Bug (without subtask):
  - Junior Developers: {JBDCMIN} points
  - Senior Developers: {SBDCMIN} points

- Story (with subtask):
  - Junior Developers: {JSDCMAX} points
  - Senior Developers: {SSDCMAX} points

- Story (without subtask):
  - Junior Developers: {JSDCMIN} points
  - Senior Developers: {SSDCMIN} points

### Points for Task Cycle Time

Developers will be awarded points based on the time taken to move a task from
"In Progress" to "Done" as follows:

| Task Cycle Time     | Points |
| ------------------- | ------ |
| 0 minutes to 1 hour | 10     |
| 1 hour to 3 hours   | 8      |
| 3 hours to 12 hours | 6      |
| 12 hours to 1 day   | 4      |
| 1 day to 2 days     | 2      |
| Above 2 days        | 1      |

## Importance

The JIRA Task Cycle Scoring System aims to achieve the following:

1. **Motivating Task Completion:** By rewarding developers for completing tasks,
   this system encourages team members to actively contribute to project
   progress.

2. **Acknowledging the Complexity of Tasks:** Different task types and the
   presence of subtasks are considered to reward developers accordingly. This
   acknowledges the effort and complexity of their work.

3. **Promoting Timely Task Resolution:** The points awarded based on task cycle
   time promote faster resolution, ensuring that tasks move swiftly from "In
   Progress" to "Done," which is crucial for project efficiency.

4. **Agility:** Reducing task cycle time makes our development process more
   agile, allowing us to respond to changing requirements and priorities more
   effectively.

**In summary**, The Performance Scoring System is a framework designed to reward
and motivate developers on your team by assigning points based on their
contributions to pull requests and the completion of tasks on your JIRA board.
This system is intended to encourage efficient code review processes and timely
task completion, while also considering the level of seniority within the team.

Happy coding and collaborating!
